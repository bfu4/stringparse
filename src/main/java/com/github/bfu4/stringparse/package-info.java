/**
 * StringParse is a simple utility for handling the parsing of
 * {@link java.lang.String String}s into numbers, returning either the value
 * as requested, into the type request, or null, instead of throwing the exception.
 * It's quite a bloat project, however it was rather fun. StringParse shows usage of
 * Java's {@code Optional<T>}, {@code Function<T, R>} and tons of other fun syntactic features.
